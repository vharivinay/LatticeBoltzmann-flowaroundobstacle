# Computing Flow Around Obstacles - Uisng Lattice Boltzmann Methods

Lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM), originated from the lattice gas 
automata (LGA) method (Hardy-Pomeau-Pazzis and Frisch-Hasslacher-Pomeau 
models), is a class of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods for
fluid simulation. Instead of solving the Navierâ€“Stokes equations directly,
a fluid density on a lattice is simulated with streaming and collision 
(relaxation) processes. The method is versatile as the model fluid 
can straightforwardly be made to mimic common fluid behaviour like 
vapour/liquid coexistence, and so fluid systems such as liquid droplets 
can be simulated.

--- Code restructured only a bit. Contains additional comments
--- Added functionality to export a video directly from code

Dependencies: 
    ffmpeg - install using pip install ffmpeg-python
    graphviz - install using pip install graphviz

*  Inputs can be set up as desired in the flow conditons sections
*  The obstacle geometry can be changed by entering the equation of a desired shaped in obstacle_func
